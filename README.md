# CS50_Final_Project
This is my final project for Harvard's CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science. It is a note taking/to-do list.

Whith this simple application you can:
1. create a note with heading and body and the time is stamp is automatically generated
2. choose a tag from (urgent, entry, done) so that notes are grouped in these distinct groups and ordered based on their time stamp
3. change a note's tag
4. delete a note
5. receiving an email after registration, creating and deleting notes
6. change email address
7. delete your account
