# CS50_Final_Project: YourList
This is my final project for Harvardâ€™s cs50 introduction to computer and the art of programming. It is a flaks web application in which you can save notes and customize your account. 

Whith this simple application you can:
1. create a note with heading and body and the time is stamp is automatically generated
2. choose a tag from (urgent, entry, done) so that notes are grouped in these distinct groups and ordered based on their time stamp
3. change a note's tag
4. delete a note
5. receiving an email after registration, creating and deleting notes
6. change email address
7. delete your account
